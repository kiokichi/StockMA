        what is the purpose of investing?
        The benefits of investment are many and varied. To understand why investment is important, it is necessary to
        know the difference that investing makes to your finances in the long run. Let’s consider an example to look
        into this.
        <br>
        Meet Amit. He’s a 30-year old who saves around Rs. 20,000 every month. Irrespective of any hikes in his monthly
        income and any changes in his expenditure, he diligently saves up the same amount each month.
        <br>
        Now, consider these two scenarios.<br>

        <b> Scenario 1:</b><br>
        Amit saves up Rs. 20,000 per month, but he doesn’t invest the money.
        So, each year, he saves up Rs. 2,40,000.
        He plans to retire when he’s 50 years old.
        So, at the end of 20 years, when he’s 50, Amit will have Rs. 48,00,000 saved up.<br>
        Let’s now consider another scenario, where Amit invests his monthly savings instead of just keeping them
        idle.<br>

        <b> Scenario 2:</b><br>
        He invests Rs. 20,000 per month in a scheme that offers a rate of return of 12%.
        Again, he plans to retire when he’s 50 years old.<br>
        But this time, at the end of 20 years, his money will grow to Rs. 1,99,82,958.
        That’s almost Rs. 2 crores!<br>

        You see, Amit gained around Rs. 1.5 crores (Rs. 1,51,82,958 to be exact) by simply investing the amount that he
        saved each month. <br>

        <b>of investment:</b><br>
        There’s so much talk of investing and investment options these days. But have you ever stopped to wonder about
        one fundamental question - what is the purpose of investment? The answer is quite simple, really. Investments
        need to help you achieve your life goals. This includes both short-term and long-term goals.<br>

        And they vary from one person to another. One person may want to save up to buy their first house, another
        person may want to build a retirement fund, while yet another investor may want to financially secure their
        family. Since goals are so personal and unique, there’s no one-size-fits all investment plan. So, you need to
        figure out what the purpose of investment is for you, and then create an investment plan accordingly.<br>

        So, what’s the point of investing?<br>
        Notice how in the example above, investing money regularly brings about a huge difference in how it grows? That
        brings us to the main need to invest. The fundamental reason to invest your money is to create wealth.<br>

        By creating wealth, you can secure your financial situation and meet your short-term and long-term goals. And
        investing your money helps you do just that. <br>

        For instance, by merely saving your money regularly, you could maybe get the car of your dreams in another 10
        years. But when you invest your money in the right instruments, your money grows exponentially, so you can
        realise your goals faster. <br>

        And without creating wealth through investments, it may not be possible for you to sustain or upgrade your
        current lifestyle.<br>

        While creating wealth may be the primary purpose of investing your money, it is far from the only reason to do
        so. In fact, there are many other benefits of investments. Let’s take a quick look at some of the other reasons
        why you should invest your money. <br>

        <b>To meet your life goals </b><br>
        You may have many major and minor goals in life, such as starting your own line of business, buying the car of
        your dreams, or constructing your dream house. Merely saving up a part of your income may not be enough to meet
        these targets. Add to that the ever-increasing costs - and paying for your child’s education or wedding a few
        years down the line may even be impossible with merely your savings. <br>

        Here’s where investments come in handy. You’ve seen how it may be possible to earn up to Rs. 2 crores with just
        a monthly investment of Rs. 20,000. That could be adequate to meet many life goals. And the cherry on the top is
        that you can meet your objectives without incurring any debts whatsoever!<br>


        <b>To save for retirement</b><br>
        There’s no point in working hard throughout your life if you cannot have a financially secure life
        post-retirement, isn’t it? Regularly investing your savings in a secure, retirement-friendly scheme can help
        protect you and your spouse from having to live through such a situation.<br>

        Like Amit, with the right investments, your investment corpus can grow significantly by the time you retire. So,
        you could live a secure and debt-free life after you’ve retired. The passive income that you earn from your
        investments can keep you financially independent and free to pursue your dreams in your golden years. <br>

        <b>To be prepared for emergencies</b><br>
        The thing with emergency situations is that you never know when they’ll crop up. But it’s always best to be
        prepared. As the noted novelist Franz Kafka once said, “Better to have and not need, than to need and not have.”
        Going by this, it’s advisable to have a set of investments that function as contingency funds, so you can rely
        on them in case of any unforeseen financial emergencies. <br><br>

        Having adequate emergency funds as backup gives you the confidence to take on any curveball that life might
        throw your way. And when you invest your savings, you ensure that you’re financially prepared to deal with both
        medical and non-medical emergencies. This may not be possible when you’re merely saving up. <br>

        <b>To deal with the growing costs of living</b><br>
        You’re perhaps already aware that the costs of living are constantly on an uptrend, irrespective of where you
        live. The cost of everyday requirements, right from groceries to medicines, appear to constantly be on the rise.
        <br>

        As inflation continues to rise, the value of money drops, the cost of goods rises simultaneously and your
        purchasing power decreases. In such a situation, with just your savings backing you up, you might find it tough
        to sustain your current lifestyle as the years go by. <br>

        However, by investing your money smartly in instruments like equity, you can enjoy a rate of return that may be
        significantly higher than the prevailing rates of inflation. This allows you to deal with the ever-growing costs
        of living. What’s more, it can even give you ample opportunities to upgrade your lifestyle as well! <br>

        <b>To reduce the burden of taxes</b><br>
        You’ll agree with us when we say that taxes can eat into your savings and your earnings. But what if we told you
        that by simply investing your money in the right instruments, you can lower your tax burden? <br>

        The Income Tax Act, 1961, offers a lot of scope for tax planning. For instance, section 80C of the Act, which is
        one of the most widely used provisions, permits you to claim the amount invested in certain investments as
        deductions from your total taxable income. This can significantly lower your tax liability.<br>

        Additionally, several investment options such as Equity Linked Savings Scheme (ELSS), Public Provident Fund
        (PPF) and Unit Linked Insurance Plans (ULIPs) give you a variety of tax exemptions. So, that’s another reason to
        invest your money.<br>
        <hr>
        <b> Chapter 2:</b><br>
        When is The Right Time To Invest In Shares?

        The answer to this question may well just lie in this popular quip: The best time to invest was yesterday. The
        next best time is now.<br>

        This essentially means that the right time to begin investing is ‘as soon as you can.’ Ideally, you should begin
        investing right from the time you receive your first pay check.<br>

        The answer seems to be pretty simple, isn’t it? However, there’s a catch. Your financial situation plays a huge
        role in determining the right time to invest. <br>

        Look at 25-year-old Pranav, for instance. He took home his first pay check a couple of years back. But at that
        time, he was 23 and already had a couple of loans to his name. Most of his salary went towards settling those
        debts. The rest of his pay check covered his regular expenses, leaving no room for investing.

        Like Pranav, if you too have various other financial obligations, it may not really be feasible for you to start
        investing right from the time you receive your first salary. But that’s okay. It’s best to get your
        high-interest debts cleared before you commit to an investment. <br>

        Start off small, but start early
        A common misconception is that investing is only possible when you have a lump sum amount saved up. But that’s
        not entirely true. You could start by investing small amounts. It doesn’t matter if these small amounts are only
        a tiny fraction of your income. What’s more important is that you start your investment journey early in life.

        <b> Chapter 3:</b><br>

        <b>Financial markets </b>- an overview<br>
        Think of your local marketplace. There are perhaps many stalls selling different kinds of goods and products,
        aren’t there? And they’re constantly buzzing with activity. If we asked you what your local marketplace is,
        you’ll probably say that it’s a space where both buyers and sellers come together to buy and sell goods. <br>

        So, what are financial markets? Much like your local marketplace, the financial markets are also virtual or
        physical spaces that are dedicated to the purchase and sale of one kind of product - financial assets. These
        financial assets can be anything, ranging from stocks and bonds to commodities and currencies.<br>

        Financial markets are also sometimes referred to as the ‘capital markets’ or simply ‘the markets.’ Whatever the
        name may be, the core nature of the financial markets always remains the same - they’re designated spaces where
        financial assets are traded.<br>

        <b> What are financial markets?</b><br>
        The term ‘financial markets’ refers to those marketplaces where financial assets are bought and sold. Financial
        assets include instruments like stocks and bonds. Broadly speaking, the financial markets include various
        smaller marketplaces like the stock market, the bond market, the forex market, the commodities market and the
        derivatives market.<br>

        Some financial markets are regulated, while some may not be. And as with any marketplace, the prices of the
        financial assets traded in financial markets also keep fluctuating based on a number of factors. Interested
        traders and investors can take advantage of these price movements to earn returns on their investments.<br>
        <hr>
        <b> Chapter 4:</b><br>Types and Functions of Financial Markets
        <br>
        <b> By nature of claim </b><br>
        Financial markets can be classified based on the type of claim that you have over the assets you’ve invested in.
        Broadly speaking, your claim on your investments can be any one of two types: fixed or residual. This paves way
        for two kinds of financial markets, as you’ll see below.<br>

        <b> Debt market </b><br>
        In a debt market, debt instruments like bonds and debentures are bought and sold. These instruments are issued
        by companies and government entities. And when you buy a debt instrument, your claim on the assets of the
        issuing entity is fixed. In other words, it’s limited to a specific amount. <br>

        For example, say you invest in a bond with a face value of Rs. 5,000 and a coupon rate of 10%. Each year, you’ll
        receive a fixed amount of Rs. 500 (10% of Rs. 5,000).
        <br>
        <b> Equity market </b><br>
        Stocks of public limited companies are traded in the equity market. Here, you can carry out a variety of trades
        such as intraday transactions, delivery trades, Initial Public Offers (IPOs) and Follow on Public Offers (FPOs).
        Your claim on the stocks you buy in the equity market is residual. <br>

        What this means is that when you buy a company’s stock, you effectively become a shareholder in that company.
        And in the event that the company calls it quits and is liquidated, whatever remains in the business after all
        fixed liabilities have been paid off belongs to shareholders like you.<br>

        <b>By maturity of claim</b><br>
        Anybody who has ever had a garden at home will tell you that not all plants grow at the same rate. Some, like
        the marigold, flower within a few weeks. Others, like the Himalayan Lily, take years to bloom. <br>

        Much like this, different investments also offer returns at different tenures. In this context, maturity refers
        to the period after which an investment matures. Some assets have a shorter tenure, while others may have a
        longer maturity period. Based on this, there are two types of financial markets. <br>

        <b> Money market </b><br>
        This is the market where monetary assets like treasury bills, commercial papers and certificates of deposits can
        be bought and sold. The investment horizon for these assets does not exceed a year. As a result, the risk
        associated with these instruments is also quite low. In addition to this, they offer returns in the form of
        interest.
        <br>
        <b> Capital market</b><br>
        In a capital market, assets with medium-term and long-term investment horizons are traded. For instance,
        investors can buy assets like equity share capital and preference share capital and hold them over the long
        term. Capital markets are once again divided into the following two subcategories: primary market and secondary
        market.
        <br>
        <b> Primary market: </b><br>
        Here’s where newly listed companies issue securities for the first time, through Initial Public Offers (IPOs).
        It’s also here that companies that are already listed make fresh issues of securities through Follow on Public
        Offers (FPOs). Essentially, transactions in the primary markets occur between companies and their shareholders.
        <br>
        <b> Secondary market:</b><br>
        In a secondary market, existing securities of listed companies are traded over stock exchanges between
        investors. It’s where you buy stocks or sell them in the course of your everyday trading.<br>
        <hr>
        <b> Chapter 5:</b><br>Key Stock Market Players in the Stock Exchange<br>

        Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI)
        Established in the year 1988, the Securities and Exchange Board of India is a government entity that’s
        responsible for the regulation of financial markets in the country. The main functions of SEBI include promotion
        of the securities market in India, protection of the investors’ interests and regulation of all the activities
        that take place in the market. <br>

        Let’s take a quick look at what the SEBI does to make sure that the financial markets are not disturbed. <br>


        Frames rules and regulations that dictate the way financial markets should be operated
        Keeps an eye on the operations of various stock and commodity exchanges
        Protects the interests of retail investors
        Ensures that there is no manipulation of markets
        Keeps stockbrokers, corporates and other market participants in check
        Stock Exchanges
        Assume you have a house to sell. Who do you get in touch with to help connect you to a prospective buyer? A real
        estate agent, right? On a similar note, stock exchanges in India are financial intermediaries that connect
        buyers and sellers and facilitate a trade of the stocks listed on that exchange. <br>


        There are two principal stock exchanges in India - the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and the National Stock
        Exchange (NSE). In addition to these two exchanges, there are also other small exchanges such as the Calcutta
        Stock Exchange and the Metropolitan Stock Exchange of India that are currently operational. <br>

        exchanges in india.<br>

            Capital Stock Exchange Kerala Ltd.,Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala
            Depositories</pre>
      A depository allows you to store the dematerialised share certificates of the stocks you own in a dedicated
      account. This account is known as a demat account. It’s effectively a digital account that acts as a storage space
      for all the shares you hold in the electronic format. <br>


      In India, there are currently two depositories that are operational - the National Securities Depository Limited
      (NSDL) and Central Securities Depository Limited (CDSL).
      <br>

      Depository Participants
      A depository participant (DP) is a registered agent who acts as an intermediary between you and the depository. As
      an investor, you cannot deal with or open a demat account directly with a depository. You’re required to route all
      your transactions with a depository only through a DP.<br>
